# Latin declinator
## Overview
This project is a tool for people who need to decline latin words in the o/a and third declination class.
## Live preview
You can visit a life preview on [this site](https://latin-declinator.web.app/). To decline a word, you just need to fill in the word in the table.

## Contribution
I'm happy when you can help me by adding some special special cases to the code. You should just need to edit the [table](https://github.com/just-dev-creator/angular-latin-declinator/tree/master/declinator/src/app/table) and [form](https://github.com/just-dev-creator/angular-latin-declinator/tree/master/declinator/src/app/form) component for this. Other help is of course also greatly appreciated.
Please make your pull requests to the dev branch as master is for production only.
